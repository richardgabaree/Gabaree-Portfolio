# Title Homework 2 Potfolio

Created beginninh profile for UT Coding Class

## Description

To create this document I used the following:

HTML
CSS 
BootStrap - from getboostrap.com
unSplash.com

Using the above programs, I created a index.html, that includes my pic and information about myself. The portfolio.html is set up with placeholders for future work. and the contact.html is used to reach out to me. 

Also created was an assets folder that contains a css and image folder.  

I pulled the backdrop from unSplash. The idea of the look is retro with a touch of modern. 

### Usage
